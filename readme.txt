Tetris! 

This project (not complete!) follows the excellent tutorial by Ania Kubow, which 
I found via freeCodeCamp.org.

Current status: 
- .html, .js. and .css all created and working functionally. 
- about halfway through the tutorial. 

Self-goals:
- get more comfortable with Atom
- utilze Git and GitHub more
- increase JS knowledge
- understand connectivity between JS, HTML, CSS
